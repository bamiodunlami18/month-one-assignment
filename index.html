        <hr>

        <p>I’m Bamidele Odunlami, a tech enthusiast with a deep love for innovation and problem-solving. <br> 
            Originally from Abeokuta, Nigeria, I now call the United Kingdom home, where I work as a retail manager <br>
            at one of the biggest grocery stores in the country. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey started with Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Federal Polytechnic Ilaro, where I graduated <br>
             with distinction. From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by technology, how things work, how they can be <br>
             improved, and how they shape our world. That curiosity led me to explore programming, giving me a basic <br>
             foundation in C++, and now, I’m actively working towards becoming a backend engineer.
        </p>
            
        <p>Even in retail, I find ways to bring innovation into my work, whether it’s through problem-solving, <br>
            process optimization, or understanding how technology can enhance efficiency. My passion lies in building<br>
            things, whether it’s physical electronics or backend systems that power modern applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I continue my journey, I’m focused on growing my skills in backend development, learning new technologies,<br>
            and one day making a meaningful impact in the tech industry. For me, innovation isn’t just a buzzword, it’s a mindset.

        <h2><strong>WHY ALTSCHOOL AFRICA</strong></h2>
        <hr>

        <p>
            I first came across Altschool Africa, a diploma-awarding tech learning center, through a tweet by <a href="https://x.com/hackSultan">Hacksultan</a> on <a href="https://www.x.com">X</a>. <br>
            He shared inspiring stories of people who had enrolled, learned valuable skills, and landed jobs at top organizations. <br>
            Intrigued, I decided to check out the platform <a href="https://www.altschoolafrica.com" target="_blank">Altschool Africa</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, I wasn’t sure which tech path to take, I just knew that I loved coding. To find clarity, <br>
            I conducted research and took personal assessments to determine whether frontend or backend engineering suited me better.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing <a href="#about-me">about me</a>, I’m an introvert. I prefer working behind the scenes, focusing on structure and functionality rather <br>
            than what’s loud or flashy. That realization became the foundation for my decision to pursue backend engineering, <br>
            where I can build the core systems that power applications while staying in my element.<br>
        </p>

        <!-- Why backend engineering -->
        <hr>
        <h2><strong>BACKEND ENGINEERING</strong></h2>
        <hr>

        <P>
            I chose backend engineering because it aligns with my strengths and interests. As someone who prefers working behind the scenes,<br>
            I love the idea of building the core functionality of applications, the part that makes everything work. Backend developers are <br>
            the backbone of any software system, handling databases, servers, and APIs, ensuring everything runs smoothly.<br>
        </P>
        <p>
            Another key factor in my decision was the depth of knowledge backend engineers have. They work with multiple programming languages,<br>
             databases, and system architectures, making them highly skilled problem-solvers. I wanted to challenge myself and gain a solid <br>
             foundation in complex technical concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, I can’t ignore the salary aspect—backend engineers generally earn more than frontend developers, which was an added <br>
            motivation for me. The combination of technical depth, problem-solving, and financial reward made backend engineering the perfect <br>
            choice for me.
        </p>

         <!-- My goal -->

        <h2><strong>MY GOAL</strong></h2>
        <hr>

        <!-- the 5 years goal -->
        <h3><strong>My 5 years goal as in Backend Engineering</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Over the next five years, my primary goal is to successfully complete Altschool Africa, mastering the foundations of backend engineering.<br>
             After my first year, I plan to secure an internship to gain real-world experience and apply my skills in a professional setting.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, I aim to climb the backend engineering career ladder, continuously learning, working on impactful projects, and improving my <br>
            expertise. My ultimate goal is to gain extensive experience and rise to a senior backend engineering role, becoming highly skilled in <br>
            building scalable and efficient systems.
        </p>
         <!-- my future goal in backend engineering -->
        <h3><strong>My long term goal in backend engineering</strong></h3>
        <p>
            In the long run, my dream is to build an app that solves real-time problems and makes a meaningful impact on people's lives—something <br>
            as innovative and useful as <a href="https://www.piggyvest.com/">PiggyVest</a>. I love the idea of seeing my code bring smiles to people's faces, creating solutions that truly matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond just building an app, I want to create something that lasts—a product that stands the test of time, evolves, and continues to provide value. <br>
            Ultimately, I aspire to achieve freedom, both financially and in my career, where I can work on my terms, build impactful solutions, and contribute <br>
             to the tech ecosystem in a way that feels fulfilling.
